## Community Interaction: How to Communicate with Others

**Be honest, friendly, and kind.**

This is our most important rule. Our admin team allows everyone to substantiate their standpoint. However, you must follow the local customs and comply with the laws of the country relevant to the discussion topic.

## Profile vs. Account: Understanding Your Rights

It's crucial to understand the difference between your Profile and your Account, as this defines your data rights and community access.

*   **Profile**: This is your **MaicText record** and collection of **personal information**. You must agree to the *Maichc.club Service Terms* to create one online. You **retain permanent ownership** of your Profile data.
*   **Account**: The full name is your ***Maichc.club Community Account***. It is your **identity for communication** within the community. You use your Profile to **lease this Account long-term**. You must agree to the *Community Agreement* before using it.

**Key Clarification**:
You may request to **retrieve and permanently delete** your personal Profile data. However, this action will result in the **termination of your Community Account**. All data (except for certificates of honor) will be expunged from our servers.

## Honors & History: No One Is Always Right

We will not deny your achievements and history. This glory is yours and cannot be changed by anyone. It is visible to everyone at your account address.

> Excerpt from the *Maichc.club Service Terms*:
> Once awarded, an honor is entered directly into your Profile and **cannot be revoked**. A unique hash value is also generated for verification. The suspension of a Community Account does not mean you lose access to your Profile data; however, you will no longer be able to access the blocked Account.

## Collective Illusion: A Concerning Development

For communities with distinct characteristics, we strive to prevent the emergence of "Collective Illusions." A mature collective illusion typically consists of three key components and is essentially an extreme product of group cognitive closure and identity formation.

1.  **A Shared Core Belief**: An unquestionable central tenet (e.g., "Our idol is perfect," "Our industry's technology will change the world," "This AI model is nearing artificial general intelligence").

2.  **A Self-Reinforcing Information Loop**: A set of internally coherent language, information sources, and narratives used to continuously validate and strengthen the core belief.

3.  **A Powerful Mechanism of Exclusivity**: A system to identify, reject, and eliminate any external or internal information that challenges the core belief. **Here, exclusivity functions as the immune system that prevents the illusion from being shattered.**

**It manifests in the following ways**:

*   **Defines Boundaries**: Exclusive actions define the line between "us" and "them." Inside the bubble is safe, correct, and pure; outside is dangerous, wrong, and corrupt.
*   **Maintains Internal Pressure**: The mechanism ensures internal pressure within the bubble remains higher than external pressure, so any "dissenting view" attempting to enter is immediately expelled, maintaining the illusion's stability and uniformity.
*   **Filters Reality**: Exclusivity acts as an information filter, allowing only illusion-confirming information in, while distorting or rejecting contradictory facts. The result is not the group perceiving reality, but the group **constructing a reality based on its own imagination**.
*   **Self-Reinforcement**: Every successful act of exclusion (e.g., reporting a critic, refuting a challenge) is celebrated as a group victory, further strengthening group identity and belief in the shared illusion, making the bubble even more resilient.
