# How to easily use it

**Linux/POSIX**
```sh
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -o kv.qis all-in-one.cpp
```

**Windows**
1. download from [Mircosoft Visual Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/insiders/)

2. new a project.
3. move file `all-in-one.cpp` to IDE.
4. run it.

# Notes
This is a rebuild version. Because the open-source(QCR_Framework) file is lost, I can't guarantee that it's OK like before.

But it can run. <s>emoji also...</s>
